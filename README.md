Here is a basic Quiz Game developed in Python using the language "import" system.

I have a basic UI of this code using HTML.

You can modify the code by adding, removing, or changing the questions as follows:

In the constant QUESTION, you can choose the number of questions the player has to answer. In the question_answer dictionary, you can specify the questions and their corresponding correct answers. You can add more questions than the required number to provide variability for the quiz:

	QUESTION = number of questions

	question_answer = {
		"question": "correct answer"
	}

Feel free to make any changes to the code to suit your preferences.
